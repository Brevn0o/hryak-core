# Hryak Core

This is the core of the Hryak bot, a Tamagotchi-type Discord bot where you can feed and raise your own pig. The pig will grow, you will earn money, and youâ€™ll be able to buy new items for your piggy. Players can trade items with one another, creating a user-driven economy.

This package is created to efficiently communicate with database and manage the bot's core logic. It is designed to be used with the Hryak Bot in discord, but can also be used independently for other projects since it's not tightly coupled with discord API
